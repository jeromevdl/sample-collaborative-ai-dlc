# Prerequisites

Before you begin, install and verify the following tools.

## Local development

You need the following tools to run AIDLC Collaborative locally.

npm --version    # Expected output: 10.x or later
git --version    # Expected output: 2.x
```

## AWS deployment

You need the following additional tools to deploy AIDLC Collaborative to AWS. For detailed deployment instructions, see [Setup](setup.md).

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **[Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)** | 1.0 or later | Infrastructure provisioning |
| **[AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)** | v2 | AWS resource management and credential handling |
| **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)** | 20.10 or later | Lambda packaging and container builds |

Run the following commands to confirm your deployment tools are installed.

```bash
terraform --version  # Expected output: v1.0 or later
aws --version        # Expected output: aws-cli/2.x
docker --version     # Expected output: Docker version 20.10 or later
```

You also need an AWS account with permissions to manage the following services.

| Category | Services |
|----------|----------|
| Compute | Lambda, ECS Fargate, Step Functions |
| Networking | VPC, API Gateway, CloudFront |
| Storage | S3, DynamoDB, Neptune |
| Security | Cognito, IAM, Secrets Manager |
| Integration | EventBridge, ECR |


## Optional tools

The following tools are optional. Install them to enable additional features.

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **AWS credentials** | Required for large language model (LLM) features through [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) |
| **GitHub personal access token** | Enables pushing tasks as GitHub issues and syncing issue status |
| **Kiro CLI** | Required for agent execution in the Construction phase |

## AWS credentials for LLM features

AIDLC Collaborative uses [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html) to access Claude models. You need valid AWS credentials with Amazon Bedrock access in your environment.

To configure credentials, set the following environment variables.

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret
export AWS_REGION=us-east-1
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1
```

You can also use [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html), IAM roles, or any method supported by the [AWS SDK credential provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/standardized-credentials.html).

If you do not have AWS credentials, the platform still starts. You can browse the UI, create organizations and projects, and manage specs. The LLM chat and agent features fail with a connection error.
